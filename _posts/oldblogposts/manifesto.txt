I've been doing myself a disservice. I assumed that by selflessly devoting myself and my time to the company I work for, my efforts would be rewarded in time both personally and fiscally. I've put in the extra hours to get that project done in unrealistic timelines; I've neglected my family and friends; I've neglected my public profile, output and intellectual curiosity so that I could 'get more done' for the company. This has only left me feeling underpaid,undervalued and under-appreciated. This experiment has been a failure.

**I should have known better.**

Do I have an inflated sense of worth?
Maybe. I guess we'll just have to see... Given the interactions I've had over the years with people I don't feel like my estimation of my skills is over-inflated. If anything I feel bolstered by the process of hiring new people and following the output of others...

I became a father way too early and started school way too late to benefit from the insane amounts of productivity and free-time associated with college attendance. Having to work full-time while attending school I never gave myself the time to express myself in public view. I instead tried to focus on raising my profile within the company slowly but surely. I've turned down potentially lucrative side jobs because I needed the time to focus on real 'work'. I left jobs working for small businesses where gratitude was divvied out like candy for my efforts and traded it all in to be a cog in the corporate machine, the idea being that it would be more *stable* and financially rewarding in time.

**I've learned that this is an invalid assumption.**

This all changes today.

Today I'm recommitting myself to being more open and honest. My free time will be my own. I'll focus on being part of a larger community of professionals by contributing what I can to open source. I'll try to lead by action, putting myself, my thoughts and my code out there for the public to see.

The world is changing. The landscape of the internet is changing. If I'm ever to land that 'dream' job I'm not going to get it by slaving away in a corporation anymore. I'll demonstrate my value and knowledge publicly.

Hopefully someone will take notice. 

Not going to get there treading water...
