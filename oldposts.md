title : I was reading a little online about Japanese mythology and religion..

and came across this <a href="http://www5.ocn.ne.jp/~magi9/isracame.htm">link</a>, which makes a very
good argument that maybe some of the lost tribes of Israel actually crossed
the Silk Road and ended up in Japan. Very, very interesting stuff.

title : Time for Nostalgia..

growing up the Red Hot Chili Peppers (mother's milk era) were quite an influence. Lately, i've found a few recent solo recordings of <a href="http://www.johnfrusciante.com/">John Frusciante</a>, and have not been able to stop jamming them on my iPod.. Simply amazing. I'd recommend people check out 'Curtains'. Masterpiece is an understatement. I'm really glad he's doing well and is off drugs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frusciante">info</a> Thank you sir for creating great music and sharing it with us humans.

"We can't be incidental or accidental. We must fix our gaze on a a guiding star as soon as one comes upon the horizon.

title : I've <a href="http://hamant.net/index.cgi/coolstuff/nightofdead.html">mentioned this before</a>...

But the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is quite an amazing web site. Think of all the libraries you can go to look up info in newspapers or books. Libraries archive that stuff on microfiche, so it's pretty easy to locate an article in the New York Times from Nov. 18, 1884. But where can you go to look at someone's article on your favorite websites, or a news broadcast from the first Iraq War? Some of the most influential parts of our culture are no longer available to anyone. Films from early parts of the industry's history have been totally lost. So I think it is important to use technology and good <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">law</a> to enrich our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Public Domain</a>. The reason I write this is probably cause i've been reading/listening to <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Larry Lessig's</a> most recent book <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc">Free Culture</a>. I've read all this other books, and this one by far best condenses the problems facing cuture and law brought upon by technology such as the internet. I recommend checking it out (It's free under CC btw).

title : The situation in the world is sad.

Is it possible to save the world from itself? Can the world's problems ever be solved? Terrorists are bankrupting efforts in to stabilize Iraq, everyone wants N Korea to lay off the nukes, they don't want to. Entire regions of Africa are in constant civil war with millions of people dying. We may be destroying the planet with our greenhouse gas emissions. Taiwan wants independence from China (which I think every country should have the right to fight for), but China says no... We of course don't want to engage China on behalf of Taiwan, but we don't want to lose trade relations with our favorite maker of toys (not even mentioning Tibet). Arafat looks like he has two feet in the grave, this will breakdown control in Palestine  leaving groups like Hamas to fend for themselves, ignoring the lead of whoever happens to head up the new provisional government. This will of course de-stabilize things with Israel and the world continues to fall to shit. Maybe I can understand why so many Americans are looking at God, Morals, and Bush for help. So much of the world is out of control. Will it ever stabilize? Most of us never seen a major world war in our lifetime.. Is this inevitable? How/When does it end?

I watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0391024/">Control Room</a>, a film telling a story from the perspective of <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/">Al Jezeera</a>. Although I can recognize the 'Farenheit911' effect, I feel this is one of the best documentaries i've seen in quite a while. At it's core it wasn't about Al Jezeera as much it was an analysis of how the media controls the information you see. The most interesting thing about the movie was watching the American soldier who was a liaison at Central Command, he had an interesting point about how he felt seeing dead American soldiers on TV. He explained how it affected him to see dead soldiers on TV, but somehow he felt less emotional about see even gorier images of dead Iraqis. Worth a see. "History is written by the victors". 
ALSO! look at <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/0EE30E43-B137-417C-9FA4-E629E849E7DC.htm">these</a>
